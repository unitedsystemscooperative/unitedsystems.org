## What's New in 2021-08?

- Progressive Web App (PWA) - The application is now a PWA. This means much of what you use will be cached on your system and you can go offline (provided you've visited the page at least once).

    Note: Access to external pages or pages that require authorization will not work while offline.

- Site Map has been added to the footer. All main access paths are accessible.
- Stub page for Developer information has been created and is under construction currently.

### New Admin functionalities

These items are for those in Command.

- Admin page has been corrected to use the database to verify if one is permitted access, rather than the session cookie.
- Commander Dashboard
  - Added new Promotion Member view.
  - Inara Link column has been adjusted to an icon button rather than a button with text.
  - Adjustments have been made to attempt to improve sort and search.
  - Ambassadors list has been created.
- Created Vote Assistant. This lists all current command members and their yay/nay vote.
