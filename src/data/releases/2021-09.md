## What's New in 2021-09?

- Styles - The styles of the website have been updated to match material-ui's rebrand to mui.
- Join Form has been updated to match the new questions

### Under the hood

- The Navbar and Footer have been moved into the base website file so they will appear at all times. This should also improve their stability.
- All dependencies have been updated as able. This includes NextJS, react-hook-forms, the database, etc.
