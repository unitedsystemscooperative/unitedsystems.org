## Rules of Thumb

Note: You should attempt to get your REP up to allied before attempting to take missions. The higher the REP, the better the missions you receive.

### Adding Influence

There are multiple ways to add influence:

- Complete INF missions. The more +'s the better.
- Bounty Hunting - Dropping the bounties at a station where the giver of the bounty has a presence.
- Exploration Data hand-in - Increases INF for the owner of the station.
- Commodity Trading - Increases INF for the owner of the station.
- Interstellar Factors - Increases INF for the owner of the station.

### Decreasing Influence

- Completing INF missions for other factions in the system.
- "Clean Killing" - Killing innocent NPCs of that faction. This is considered illegal and can bring System Authority against you.
- Black Market Trading - Bringing illegal/illicit goods and selling them to a station will decrease the station owner's INF.
- Failing missions - Failing missions, whether intentional or not, will decrease the mission faction's INF.

  Note: Aborting the mission will only decrease your REP without affecting INF.

### Diminishing Returns

Too much of one thing is too much. There are caps in place to prevent over-inflating changes in influence

## Conflicts

### Elections

Complete election missions to win the conflict.

### Wars

Wars are won in two ways:

- Confict Zones
- Combat Bonds

Diminishing returns are a possiblility here. Following the list below, a maxiumum of 9 should be a good cap.

| Conflict Zone Level | Number Complete |
| ------------------- | :-------------: |
| Low                 |        1        |
| Medium              |        2        |
| High                |        3        |
