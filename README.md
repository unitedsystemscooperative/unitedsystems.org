## United Systems Cooperative

The USC is a player group of the game Elite: Dangerous.

Established in the game's year of 3306 (2020), the group has around 150 members from all across the globe.

## This site

This site was designed near the end of 2020 when the legacy site was unable to handle the new features of the USC Build system. Written once in Create React App, then moved into Next.js, the site has grown to encompass most of USC's knowledge of the game that has not been found in other places on the internet.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js / React
- MongoDb
- TypeScript
- next-auth
- swr
- mui
- vercel
- Testing:
  - cypress
  - jest
  - msw (to mock api requests)
